                        Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy. If youâ€™re using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.

                    <p>Cover your head and neck with your arms. If a sturdy table or desk is nearby, crawl underneath it for shelter. If no shelter is nearby, crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows). Crawl only if you can reach better cover without going through an area with more debris. Stay on your knees or bent over to protect vital organs.</p>

Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area.</p>
