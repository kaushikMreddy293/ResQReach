        An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep underneath the earthâ€™s surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. While they can happen anywhere without warning, areas at higher risk for earthquakes include Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Washington and the entire Mississippi River Valley.
